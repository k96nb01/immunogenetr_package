\usage{
HLA_mismatch_logical(
  GL_string_recip,
  GL_string_donor,
  loci,
  direction = c("HvG", "GvH", "bidirectional"),
  homozygous_count = 2
)
}
\arguments{
\item{GL_string_recip}{A GL strings representing the recipient's HLA genotypes.}

\item{GL_string_donor}{A GL strings representing the donor's HLA genotypes.}

\item{loci}{A character vector specifying the loci to be considered for
mismatch calculation.}

\item{direction}{A character string indicating the direction of mismatch.
Options are "HvG" (host vs. graft), "GvH" (graft vs. host), or
"bidirectional" (max of "HvG" and "GvH").}

\item{homozygous_count}{An integer specifying how to handle homozygosity.
Defaults to 2, where homozygous alleles are treated as duplicated for
mismatch calculations. Can be specified to be 1, in which case homozygous
alleles are treated as single occurrences without duplication.}
}
\value{
A logical value (`TRUE` or `FALSE`):
- `TRUE` if there are mismatches between recipient and donor HLA alleles.
- `FALSE` if there are no mismatches.
}
\description{
Determines if there are any mismatches between recipient and
donor HLA alleles for the specified loci. Returns `TRUE` if mismatches are
present, and `FALSE` otherwise.

\examples{
# Example recipient and donor GL strings
GL_string_recip <- "HLA-A*03:01+HLA-A*74:01^HLA-DRB3*03:01^HLA-DRB5*02:21"
GL_string_donor <- "HLA-A*03:02+HLA-A*20:01^HLA-DRB3*03:01"

# Check if there are mismatches for HLA-A (Graft vs. Host)
has_mismatch <- HLA_mismatch_logical(GL_string_recip, GL_string_donor, loci =
"HLA-A", direction = "GvH")
print(has_mismatch)
# Output: TRUE
