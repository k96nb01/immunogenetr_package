* Updated `ambiguity_table_to_GLstring` to remove duplicate entries from an ambiguity table as it is being processed to a GL string. Added this functionality to `HLA_truncate` so that truncated GL strings could optionally remove duplicates. Added `GLstring_to_ambiguity_table` as an alias for `GL_string_expand_longer`.
