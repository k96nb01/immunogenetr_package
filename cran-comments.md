* Added a disclaimer to the package for it being for research use only. Added a disclaimer to the help file for `HLA_truncate` to warn users about the ability to make non-WHO-compliant allele names with certain settings. Updated `HLA_mismatch_base` to better handle missing loci at the DRB3/4/5 locus.
