Description: immunogenetr is a comprehensive toolkit for clinical HLA
    informatics. It is built on tidyverse
    <https://tidyverse.tidyverse.org/> principles and makes use of
    genotype list string (GL string, <https://glstring.org/>) for storing
    and using HLA genotype data.  Specific functionalities of this library
    include: coercion of HLA data in tabular format to and from GL string;
    calculation of matching and mismatching in all directions, with
    multiple output formats; automatic formatting of HLA data for
    searching within a GL string; truncation of molecular HLA data to a
    specific number of fields; and reading HLA genotypes in HML files and
    extracting the GL string.
